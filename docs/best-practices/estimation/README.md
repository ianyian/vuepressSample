# Task Estimation Checklist



The checklist is divided into two, Effort and Schedule. The effort refers to the actual time it takes to complete a task in ideal time (total number of hours, days and or weeks), for one developer. Schedule means when we can start with the task and when we can finish it, considering holidays, weekends, PTO’s, number of resources, etc. 

For example if today (Tuesday January 14th) we estimated an effort of 10 days, this does not mean we are committing to deliver on Friday January 24th. The Schedule and commitment date depends on holidays, number of resources, etc.



**Level of Effort Estimation (Effort)**

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | Is what you are estimating, clearly  defined?                |
|      | Do you fully understand the requirement?                     |
|      | Did you estimate in ideal time?                              |
|      | Is the estimate broken down into enough  detail to expose hidden work (broken down into tasks 16 hours or smaller?) |
|      | If you are new to the technology/business  domain, did you ask one or two more people to review your estimates? |
|      | Is the productivity assumed in the estimate similar to what you have achieved on similar assignments (use of  historical data if any) |
|      | Does the estimate include the Best Case,  Worst Case and Likely Case? |
|      | Is there any wishful thinking in the estimate, e.g., I can hit the most likely case if x goes well… |
|      | Did you consider the time to write the required documentation for delivering the task(s)? |
|      | Did you consider the time for creating the installers and installation package |
|      | Did you consider the time for creating and testing the upgrade script |
|      | Did you consider the time for doing unit testing for each task? |
|      | Did you consider the time for doing the integration and testing the installation on a clean environment? |

**Schedule considerations**

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | Did you consider  holidays/vacations/training and some % of unexpected PTO? |
|      | For the commitment date, did you state  clearly when and which time zone are you referring to? |
|      | Are all your assumptions made explicit on  the estimation document? |
|      | Are you considering to add extra time as a contingency for unexpected situations? |
|      | Did you consider that if a task takes 100  hours with one developer, it will not take 25 hours with four developers? Add  some buffer based on the resources and or project specifics. |

**Definitions**



**Ideal Time.** If you work 100% of the time on the task, without any interruption.

**Best Case Scenario.** How long a task would take if everything went fine and smooth. For example, there are no errors on the requirements, no issues with the technology, and so on.

**Worst Case Scenario.** How long a task would take if everything went wrong.

**Likely Case Scenario.** How long a task would take if everything went normal.
